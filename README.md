R+R
===

This is a "spreadsheet-based" low-interaction RPG I built while exploring wxPython. Excuse my awful design patterns.

Dependencies
------------

wxPython 3.x should suffice, although it was originally built on 2.8.x and Python 2.7.

Running the game
----------------

`cd` to the rplusr directory, then run `python main.py`.
